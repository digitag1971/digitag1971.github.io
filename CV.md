# Andrea Graziano

### Architect & Computational Designer

## Short Bio

Andrea Graziano is an architect and computational designer, member, and co-founder of Co-de-iT - Computational Design Italy, currently engaged in teaching international workshops about computational design, digital tools, digital and robotic fabrication in architectural design, as well as consultancy for industry and research institutes.

Andrea is co-founder of FabLab Torino and co-founder of digifabTURINg, a research cluster focused on digital fabrication, computation, robotics, and material research applied in the field of architecture, design & art.

A ‘digital explorer’ and ‘knowmad’ aiming to research, curate, and envision the rapid evolution of science, technology, and art, their possible convergence, and tooling into design and architecture.
