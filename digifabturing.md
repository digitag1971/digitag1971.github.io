**about digifabTURINg**

digifabTURINg is an applied research cluster, run between 2015 to 2020 and based in Turin, focused on digital fabrication, robotic processes, and material sciences engaged in architecture, design, and art. It uses computation as a tool to bridge the gap between industrial robotics and human creativity.

digifabTURINg rose from the collaboration between Co-de-iT, Fablab Torino, and Officine Innesto with the support of COMAU Robotics and Toolbox Coworking.

The research cluster worked mainly on the project A.A.R.M. [Algorithm - Art - Robot - Materials] that was then wrapped up into an exhibition and the release of a [free publication](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15V0hPfR2cLzz3adFnAn7P6niRR554pb-), comprehensive of two years of applied research around computational design and robotic additive manufacturing for creative applications.

digifabTURINg team: Andrea Graziano (computation and fabrication), Marco Palma (computation and fabrication), Stefano Paradiso (hardware and electronics and Bruno Demasi (hardware and crafts)
